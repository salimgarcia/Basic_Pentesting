1. Find the services exposed by the machine

```
nmap -sS -sV -sC MACHINEIP
```

2. What is the name of the hidden directory on the web server(enter name without /)?

```
gobuster dir -u MACHINEIP -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-small.txt 
```
There is a directory named 'development' with two text files inside.

3. User brute-forcing to find the username & password

Let's take a look at those text files
```
2018-04-23: I've been messing with that struts stuff, and it's pretty cool! I think it might be neat
to host that on this server too. Haven't made any real web apps yet, but I have tried that example
you get to show off how it works (and it's the REST version of the example!). Oh, and right now I'm 
using version 2.5.12, because other versions were giving me trouble. -K

2018-04-22: SMB has been configured. -K

2018-04-21: I got Apache set up. Will put in our content later. -J

```
```
For J:

I've been auditing the contents of /etc/shadow to make sure we don't have any weak credentials,
and I was able to crack your hash really easily. You know our password policy, so please follow
it? Change that password ASAP.
